# README.md

This repository contains my personal configuration files for [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs). It's a clone of the `~/.config/doom` directory, allowing me to version control my settings and recover them if needed.

## Purpose

The main purposes of this repository are:
- **Backup**: To keep a backup of my Doom Emacs configuration.
- **Version Control**: To track changes over time and revert to previous configurations if something breaks.

## Structure

The repository mirrors the structure of the `~/.config/doom` directory. The key files and directories include:

- `init.el`: The main configuration file, where Doom modules are enabled or disabled.
- `config.el`: Personal configuration file for additional settings and tweaks.
- `packages.el`: File for listing additional packages to install.

## Installation

To use this configuration:

1. Clone the repository to your `~/.config/doom` directory:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name.git ~/.config/doom
